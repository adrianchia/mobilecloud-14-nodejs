mobilecloud-14-nodejs - Video Service with Client
=================================================
This example demostrate how to consume a REST service from a server. 
We will make use of the server created from example #2 and create a NodeJS based client.

**NodeJS-http-client** uses the native http module from NodeJS to create a client, you may see additional information at http://nodejs.org/api/http.html

> This example has no external dependencies, so npm install is not required

**NodeJS-Restler-client** uses a third party library call *Restler* to simplify the creation of a REST client.

Note
You may also mix and match different programming languages for server side and client side. E.g. a NodeJS server with Java client.
